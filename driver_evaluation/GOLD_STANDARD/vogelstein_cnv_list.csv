*A gene was classifed as an Oncogene if it was included in the Cancer Gene Census (www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Census/)  and met the criteria for a high confidence amplfied gene (Class I or II) described in Santarius  et al., Nat Rev Cancer 2010;10(1):59-64.  A gene was classified as a TSG if had at least 10 documented homozygous deletions in the COSMIC database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/cosmic/) and was not co-deleted with another genes that had at least 10 documented instances of homozygous deletion.   The genes in this table exclude those that are amplified or deleted but are listed as driver genes affected by intragenic alterations (table S2A) or copy number changes (table S2B).
